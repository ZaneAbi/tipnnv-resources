# Taking Care of Details After A Fire


## What to Do

* **CONTACT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY** to report your loss. They will send an adjuster to discuss your situation.
* Protect your property from further damage, weather, vandalism, and theft.
* Arrange for board-up if necessary to prevent entry of intruders or rain. Lock outside doors.
* Contact your local disaster Relief Services ([American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/local/nevada/about-us/locations/Northern-Nevada.html) [(775) 856-1000](tel:7758561000)) for immediate help with essential needs & temporary housing. Emergency relief is provided regardless of income.
* Remove your pets (especially birds) to a cleaner and safer environment.
* Remove any valuables remaining in the building if you plan to leave the site of the fire. Try to locate and take the following items:
    * Identification
    * Medication (any medications subjected to smoke, heat, or water should be replaced).
    * Eyeglasses, hearing aids, prosthetic devices, and other personal aids.
    * Insurance policies, check books, credit cards, savings account records, money, and jewelry, etc.

* **Contact your local police.** They will keep an eye on your property during your absence.
* **Notify the following parties** of your situation and where you are locating:
    * Insurance agent or adjuster
    * Family & friends
    * Mortgage company
    * Employer
    * Children’s school
    * Post Office
    * Newspaper
    * Local fire department
    * Utilities companies
    * DMV
    * Bank & credit card companies

* If you are a tenant, contact the manager, the owner or the owner’s insurance agent. It is their responsibility to prevent further damage. Make sure your personal belongings are secure, either in the building or have them moved to another location.
* Begin collecting receipts whether you are insured or not.
* Make sure all utilities are turned off – water at the valve, gas at the meter, and electricity at the meter. **DO NOT** use any utility until it has been inspected by the utility company or by a competent professional.


## What Not To Do

* **DO NOT** sign anything immediately after property damage to home or business. Take time to read thoroughly all forms or work orders.
* **DO NOT** give anyone carte blanche for any repairs or work to be done. Get estimates.
* **DO NOT** leave the site until it is secured.
* If you have a fire safe, **DO NOT OPEN IMMEDIATELY**, even if there are important documents inside. The safe may explode or the contents ignite.
* **DO NOT** throw away any damaged property until inventoried.


## Note About Fire Remediation/Restoration

**Remember:**

It is your decision on which fire remediation/restoration company you want to use. Do not feel you have to use a company simply because they showed up or were refered by someone. Call your insurance company if you have questions.
