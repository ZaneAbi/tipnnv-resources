# Coroner's Office

## Coroner/Medical Examiner Information

The mission of the Washoe County Medical Examiner/Coroner Office is to investigate unexpected and unexplained deaths and to determine the manner of death, date, time, cause, and classification.

The Coroner’s investigation is not limited to the examination of the deceased, but may include interviews with family members and other witnesses, the collection of physical evidence and the safeguarding of personal property found at the death scene.

## Is an Autopsy Necessary

Autopsies are performed only on those cases where it is required by law or where it is necessary to determine the cause of death.

## What is an autopsy?

An autopsy is an examination of the deceased performed by a medical doctor. This examination is a professional surgical procedure that is carried out within the standards of competent medical practice.

## Will we know the _cause of death_ soon after the autopsy?

Not always. A cause of death most often takes in excess of 12-weeks to determine, particularly if toxicology tests are performed.

## What do I do now?

Contact the funeral home and/or the funeral home consumer alliance group of your choice. They are prepared to provide you information so that you can make your own selections and decisions. They will coordinate with the Coroner to arrange the release of your loved one’s remains from the Coroner’s facility.

## When can I have the funeral?

The Coroner’s examination should not delay your funeral plans. The Coroner will complete their investigation as soon as possible.

## What is required for the Coroner to release the remains/body & personal property?

The mortuary must provide the Coroner with a release form signed by the _legal next of kin_.

## If the case is pending investigation, will it delay the funeral of my loved one?

No. Death certificates are not necessary for funerals. However, some financial, estate, probate or business matters may be dependent upon the final death certificate.
