It might involve the loss of a loved one, a home, or a pet. It could involve a life-changing injury or illness. It might involve the loss of a sense of safety and security when a crime has been committed. Although our information generally reflects the death of a loved one, your emotional responses and the recommendations regarding your health and well-being can apply to all categories of traumatic loss.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The first response to your loss may be shock. You may feel numb and like the situation is unreal. You may have moments of disbelief that your loved one is really gone. Others may want you to quickly \u201caccept reality and get on with your life.\u201d Do not be hurried. There is no timetable. Accepting the reality of your loss may be a slow and gradual process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be involved in burial and funeral planning. Take the time to explore the many options available to you. Plan a service that is meaningful and special to you and your family. There are no hard and fast rules. Take charge and make whatever you decide a plan which reflects you and your family\u2019s unique wishes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delay major decisions until you have recovered from the initial turmoil following a death.</p> </li> <li> <p>How to deal with children (more information)</p> <ul> <li>Tell the truth about what happened</li> <li>Answer questions in a straightforward manner</li> <li>Let the child participate in the family sorrow and in grieving rituals</li> <li>Protect the child from imagined guilt (\u201cI was bad \u2013 it was my fault\u201d)</li> <li>Provide lots of love and reassurance</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Accept your feelings. You may find yourself experiencing a \u201croller coaster\u201d of feelings for weeks and months after the loss. Do not try to escape these feelings. They are normal. You must go through them.</p> <ul> <li>Anger: you may blame yourself, a family member, the deceased, or God for the loss (\u201cWhy me?\u201d)</li> <li>Guilt: \u201cIf only I had done . . .\u201d</li> <li>Depression: You may feel unable to perform even basic daily tasks. You may feel \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Keep a journal. It may help to write down how you are feeling. Re-reading it can help you see the healing that is taking place.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seek help from others.</p> <ul> <li>Friends and family: Talking to those outside of the immediate family may help you express your feelings without blaming those closest to you.</li> <li>Professional help: Seek professional help if despair and worthlessness persist; if your family relationships are deteriorating; or if you continue to blame yourself for what happened.</li> <li>Support groups: There are support groups where you can receive support from others who have lost a loved one.</li> <li>Nurture yourself: Do something good for yourself on a daily basis.</li> <li>Hope and healing: It may take time and work, but you can survive a terrible loss.

Here are some suggestions to help with family grief:</p> <ul> <li>Pay attention to your family members when you are with them.</li> <li>Be sensitive to how other family members feel.</li> <li>Listen to what is meant as well as what is being said.</li> <li>Accept the other person and what they say.</li> <li>Do not give each other the silent treatment. This has many negative effects.</li> <li>Sit back and listen. Let other family members have an opportunity to talk.</li> <li>Be sure to hug and touch each other at every opportunity.</li> <li>If depression, grief, or problems in your family are getting out of control, seek the advice of a counselor.</li> <li>Recognize that anniversaries, birthdays, and special holidays will be difficult for the family and each member of the family.</li> <li>Remember you can\u2019t help anyone if you are falling apart. Do what you can do and get help for what you can\u2019t do.</li> <li>Studies show that a bereaved person\u2019s self-esteem can be extremely low. Survivors should help each other to think and feel good about themselves.</li> <li>If there is a suicide note, discuss as a family what to do with it: Possible options are keeping, copying or destroying the note.</li> </ul>"}]}
