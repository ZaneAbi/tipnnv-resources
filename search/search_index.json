It might involve the loss of a loved one, a home, or a pet. It could involve a life-changing injury or illness. It might involve the loss of a sense of safety and security when a crime has been committed. Although our information generally reflects the death of a loved one, your emotional responses and the recommendations regarding your health and well-being can apply to all categories of traumatic loss.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The first response to your loss may be shock. You may feel numb and like the situation is unreal. You may have moments of disbelief that your loved one is really gone.

Accepting the reality of your loss may be a slow and gradual process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be involved in burial and funeral planning. Take the time to explore the many options available to you.

The following suggests the kinds of attitudes, words, and acts, which are truly helpful.</p> <p>The importance of such help can hardly be overstated. Bereavement can be a life-threatening condition, and your support may make a vital difference in the mourner\u2019s eventual recovery.</p> <p>Perhaps you do not feel qualified to help. You may feel uncomfortable and awkward. Such feelings are normal \u2013 don\u2019t let them keep you away. If you really care for your sorrowing friend or relative, if you can enter a little into their grief, you are qualified to help. In fact, the simple communication of the feeling of caring is probably the most important and helpful thing anyone can do.</p> <p>The following suggestions will guide you in communicating that care:</p> <ul> <li>Get in touch. Telephone. Speak either to the mourner or to someone close and ask when you can visit and how you might help. Even if much time has passed, it\u2019s never too late to express your concern.</li> <li>Say little on an early visit. In the initial period (before burial), your brief embrace, your press of the hand, your few words of affection and feeling may be all that is needed.</li> <li>Avoid clich\u00e9s and easy answers, \u201cHe is out of pain\u201d and \u201cAren\u2019t you lucky that\u2026\u201d are not likely to help. A simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is better.</li> <li>Be yourself. Show your natural concern and sorrow in your own way and in your own words.</li> <li>Keep in touch. Be available. Be there. If you are a close friend or relative, your presence might be needed from the beginning. Later, when close family may be less available, anyone\u2019s visit and phone call can be very helpful.</li> <li>Attend to practical matters. Find out if you are needed to answer the phone, usher in callers, prepare meals, clean the house, care for the children, etc. This kind of help lifts burdens and creates a bond. It might be needed well beyond the initial period, especially for the widowed.</li> <li>Encourage others to visit or help. Usually one visit will overcome a friend\u2019s discomfort and allow them to contribute further support. You might even be able to schedule some visitors so that everyone does not come at once in the beginning and fails to come at all later on.</li> <li>Accept silence. If the mourner doesn\u2019t feel like talking, don\u2019t force conversation. Silence is better than aimless chatter. The mourner should be allowed to lead.</li> <li>Be a good listener. When suffering spills over into words, you can do the one thing the bereaved needs above all else at that time \u2013 you can listen. Is she emotional? Accept that. Does he cry? Accept that too. Is she angry at God? God will manage without your defending him. Accept whatever feelings are expressed. Do not rebuke. Do not change the subject. Be as understanding as you can be.</li> <li>Do not attempt to tell the bereaved how he or she feels. You can ask (without probing), but you cannot know, except as you are told. Everyone, bereaved or not, resents an attempt to describe their feelings. To say, for example, \u201cYou must feel relieved now that he is out of pain,\u201d is presumptuous. Even to say, \u201cI know just how you feel,\u201d is questionable. Learn from the mourner, do not instruct.</li> <li>Do not probe for details about the death. If the survivor offers information, listen with understanding.</li> <li>Comfort children in the family. Do not assume that a seemingly calm child is not sorrowing. If you can, be a friend to whom feelings can be confided and with whom tears can be shed. In most cases, incidentally, children should be left in the home and not shielded from the grieving of others.</li> <li>Avoid talking to others about trivia in the presence of the recently bereaved. Prolonged discussion of sports, weather, or stock market, for example, is resented, even if done purposely to distract the mourner.</li> <li>Allow the \u201cworking through\u201d of grief. Do not whisk away clothing or hide pictures. Do not criticize seemingly morbid behavior. Young people may repeatedly visit the site of the fatal accident. A widow may sleep with her husband\u2019s pajamas as a pillow. A young child may wear his dead sibling\u2019s clothing.</li> <li>Write a letter. A sympathy card is a poor substitute for your own expression. If you take time to write of your love for and memories of the one who died, your letter might be read many times and cherished, possibly into the next generation.</li> <li>Encourage the postponement of major decisions. Whatever can wait should wait until after the period of intense grief.</li> <li>In time, gently draw the mourner into quiet outside activity. They may lose the initiative to go out on their own.</li> <li>When the mourner returns to social activity, treat him or her as a normal person. Avoid pity \u2013 it destroys self-respect. Simple understanding is enough. Acknowledge the loss, the change in the mourner\u2019s life, but don\u2019t dwell on it.</li> <li>Be aware of needed progress through grief. If the mourner seems unable to resolve anger or guilt, for example, you might suggest a consultation with a member of the clergy or other trained counselor.</li> <li>A final thought: Helping must be more than following a few rules. Especially if the bereavement is devastating and you are close to the bereaved, you may have to give more time, more care, more of yourself than you imagined. And you will have to perceive the special needs of your friend and creatively attempt to meet those needs. Such commitment and effort may even save a life. At the least, you will know the satisfaction of being truly and deeply helpful.</li> </ul> <p>Amy Hillyard Jensen Copyright \u00a9 Medic Publishing Co. P.O.
